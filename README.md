# MTA_congestion_pricing_EDA
NYC Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ) – Traffic Behavior Analysis
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using NYC's Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ) traffic data released by the MTA. This analysis identifies congestion patterns, vehicle usage behavior, toll avoidance tendencies, and more—supporting better urban mobility and toll policy design.

📈 Objective
To analyze the CRZ traffic dataset provided by the MTA, uncover traffic trends by time, location, and vehicle class, and generate insights that support urban planning, congestion pricing, and sustainability initiatives in New York City.

📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes vehicle entries into the CRZ and provides detailed logs such as:

Toll Date

10-Minute Interval

Hour of Day / Day of Week

Vehicle Class

Detection Group / Region

CRZ Entries

Excluded Roadway Entries

Time Period (Peak / Overnight)

📍 Source: MTA Open Data – Congestion Relief Zone Entries

🧪 Key Features of the Analysis
📅 Hourly & Daily Patterns: Line plots and heatmaps showing volume by time

🚗 Vehicle Class Analysis: Usage trends of cars, trucks, taxis, etc.

⏱️ Peak vs Overnight Traffic: Temporal behavior via bar charts

🛣️ Toll Avoidance Insight: CRZ vs Excluded entry ratio by region

🌉 Bridge/Tunnel Load: Top congested entry points visualized

🗺️ Interactive Mapping: Traffic volumes plotted on NYC map using Folium

📌 Key Insights
🔸 Morning peaks (6–10 AM) dominate on weekdays, especially Tuesday–Thursday.

🔸 Toll avoidance behavior is clear—Excluded road usage increases during peak hours.

🔸 Class 1 vehicles and TLC Taxis form the majority of CRZ traffic.

🔸 Lincoln Tunnel, Queens Midtown Tunnel, and East 60th Street are most congested.

🔸 Friday evenings and late Saturday nights show elevated CRZ entries, tied to nightlife and tourism.

📘 Full visualizations and explanations are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
